I'm a web engineer with 5 years of experience, mainly a full-stack JavaScript developer leaning towards the front-end.
React, Node.js, Typescript, HTML, CSS, UI libraries, API development and product / engineering management are some of my key skills.

I am currently playing with dapp development, smart contracts and the ETH ecosystem.

To pay the bills, I'm making next-gen casino games as a senior engineer for a company in Vancouver.
In my free time, I am hacking on Own Me, my next generation NFT platform similar to Only Fans.

If you wanna connect, hit me up.
