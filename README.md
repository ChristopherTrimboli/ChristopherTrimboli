I'm a web engineer with 5 years of experience, mainly a full-stack JavaScript developer leaning towards the front-end.

React, Node.js, Typescript, HTML, CSS, UI libraries, API development and product / engineering management are some of my key skills.

I am currently learning dapp development, smart contracts and the ETH ecosystem.

Fulltime, I'm a frontend team lead for a next-gen e-casino games company in Vancouver.

In my free time, I am building my startup @own-me, an edgy and sexy adult content NFT platform for the Web3 Metaverse.
